## UNFOLDING OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS:
Think of the person YOU work with (or have worked with) who you would describe as one of the more "difficult" people.
Why are they difficult?  
What is the "difficult" behavior?
Why do you think they engage in this behavior?  (avoid personality or "because they are difficult")
Have you identified an underlying motive, concern, value, or fear?  If not, go deeper... Why?  
Now that you have identified their underlying issue/interest, how can you deal with it?  Go around it?  Confront it?  Appease it?
Why do you think this particular behavior is so frustrating for you?  What does it say about YOU that you find this behavior to be "difficult"?
